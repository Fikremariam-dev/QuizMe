# QuizMe

A Flutter project.

## Getting Started

QuizMe app is a Question-and-answer app that has different categories like Tricky & Brain Riddles, General Knowledge, Science: Computers, Geography, Art, and Sport. It is a quiz app that fetches questions from an API (with exception for Tricky & Brain Riddles category which has the questions in local storage) and asks the user the questions. It then displays the score and stores the result for user statistics which can be viewed by the user.
